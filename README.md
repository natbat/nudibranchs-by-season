# Develop your naturalist superpowers with Observable Notebooks and iNaturalist

**We're going to level up your knowledge of what animals you might see in an area at a particular time of year - a skill every naturalist* strives for -  using technology! Using [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) and [Observable Notebooks](https://beta.observablehq.com/) we're going to prototype seasonality graphs for particular species in an area and automatically create a guide to what animals you might see in each month.**

**(a Naturalist is someone who likes learning about nature, not someone who's a fan of being naked, that's a '[Naturist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism)'... different thing!)*
